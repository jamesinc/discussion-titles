# DiscussionTitles

Vanilla forums addon to strip trailing punctuation from thread titles. Simply
install and enable the addon, there is no configuration.

`Some thread title?!` becomes `Some thread title`

`OK Boomer,,,,,` becomes `OK Boomer`

... and so on. It currently also captures discussion titles that end with a
question mark, however I may modify this behaviour in the future.
